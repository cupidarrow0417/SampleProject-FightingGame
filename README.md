# SampleProject (FightingGame)
It is a sample project to show my coding approaches and knowledge, also some architectures (and patterns) which I've used.

You can check the project docs [here](https://github.com/ATHellboy/SampleProject-FightingGame/tree/master/Docs).

There are some things which are good to check them out besides my coding knowledge. They are:

* Combat system which you can check out its brief doc [here](https://github.com/ATHellboy/SampleProject-FightingGame/blob/master/Docs/CombatSystem.pdf).

* Message Bus system (WIP). There is no doc for it yet but I used it in the project massively and there is an UnitTest for it.(More update in future). This message bus system is built upon [UniRx](https://github.com/neuecc/UniRx).

* Object Pooling system. It is good to check out its brief doc [here](https://github.com/ATHellboy/SampleProject-FightingGame/blob/master/Docs/ObjectPoolingSystem.pdf).

* ScriptableObjectDropdown attribute. There is a separate repository for it which you can check it out [here](https://github.com/ATHellboy/ScriptableObjectDropdown). Also ScriptableObjectMultiSelectDropdown attribute which I didn't use it in the project but you can check it out [here](https://github.com/ATHellboy/ScriptableObjectMultiSelectDropdown).

* It is not a big deal but don't forget to check my State Machine too. Its brief doc is [here](https://github.com/ATHellboy/SampleProject-FightingGame/blob/master/Docs/StateMachine.pdf).

I love IOC and DI so I used [Extenject](https://github.com/svermeulen/Extenject) (Zenject) by the great man, [Steve](https://github.com/svermeulen) in this project.
